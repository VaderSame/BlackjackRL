Both algorithms are unbiased:

They estimate the same return 
𝐺(t) , just with different sampling methods.

Every-Visit has lower bias, higher variance; First-Visit has slightly lower variance but may ignore repeat (s,a) visits.

In your case (Blackjack):

Most episodes are short, few repeated (s,a) pairs.

So the difference between "first" and "every" visit is negligible in impact.

Convergence to optimal policy happens similarly.
