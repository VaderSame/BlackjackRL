âœ… Phase 1: BlackjackRL Environment (Current Phase â€” Nearly Complete)

Status:

    Environment designed (modular, configurable).

    Core functionality (hand logic, game resets, card drawing, rewards).

Next Immediate Step:

    Finish implementing and rigorously test the step(action) method (handling hit, stand, double, surrender; leave split optional for now).

ðŸ”œ Phase 2: Environment Testing and Baseline Setup

    Create scripts/tests to validate environment correctness:

    Verify correct reward logic, action legality.

    Simulate multiple episodes with a random agent.

    Implement "Basic Strategy" agent as baseline for comparison.

ðŸ”œ Phase 3: Implement Tabular RL Methods

    Algorithms (following your papers closely):

    1. Monte Carlo (MC) for episodic policy evaluation
    
        Implement This Pipeline (Recommended Path):

        First-Visit MC Control with Îµ-greedy policy improvement

            This is your core reproducible experiment.

        Compare with Every-Visit MC Control and analyze differences

            Provides a solid ablation study.

        Add Off-Policy MC Control with Importance Sampling

            Show that you understand policy evaluation under different sampling distributions.

    2. Export strategy tables from each policy and analyze:

            Match rate with basic strategy

            Performance vs. Q-learning and PPO
    
    
    3. Q-Learning (tabular, Îµ-greedy exploration)

    

Evaluate agent performance and convergence (~millions of episodes).

ðŸ”œ Phase 4: CSV Strategy Table Generation

    Export final learned policies (from Q-learning/MC) into readable CSV tables:

    Hard hands (hard_totals.csv)

    Soft hands (soft_totals.csv)

    Splitting scenarios (splits.csv, optional)

ðŸ”œ Phase 5: Advanced Extensions (Optional but recommended)

    Implement card counting mechanisms (Hi-Lo, Zen, APC).

    Include running card count as an additional state feature.

    Retrain Q-learning or Monte Carlo with card counting enabled, assessing performance improvements.

ðŸ”œ Phase 6: Implement PPO (Policy Gradient Method)

    Replace tabular policies with neural networks.

    Use PPO to train a policy-based agent with:

    Clipped surrogate objective

    Entropy bonus

    Value loss estimation

Evaluate against previous tabular approaches.

ðŸ”œ Phase 7: Comprehensive Evaluation

    Direct comparisons (win-rates, strategy match percentages, convergence speed) across all RL algorithms:

    Random vs. Basic vs. Q-learning vs. PPO

    Final detailed report and visualizations.
