Strategy Table Overview 
- Hard Table Overview (Usable Ace = False)
Policy looks quite stable and close to basic strategy:

From 4 to 11: Mostly hit, which is expected.

Around 12–16: It starts to stand vs. dealer cards 4–6, and hits otherwise — this matches standard logic (stand when the dealer is more likely to bust).

From 17 to 21: Always stand, as expected.

 What stands out:
Looks textbook-perfect for a simplified no-surrender rule set.

- Soft Table Overview (Usable Ace = True)
Soft totals usually behave differently in basic strategy:

We’ll often hit even with higher totals (e.g., soft 17 or 18).

And our strategy chart reflects that.

Examples from your chart:

Soft 13–15 (Ace+2 to Ace+4): Mostly hit —  correct.

Soft 18 (Ace+7):

stand vs. 2, 7, 8.

hit vs. 9, 10 — classic strategy would even suggest hit or double vs. 9/10.

Soft 19–21: Always stand —  correct.
